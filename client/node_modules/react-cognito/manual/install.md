# react-cognito

If you are writing an application using react-cognito, then just install it using npm:

    npm install react-cognito --save-dev

You will also need some dependencies:

    npm install react react-dom react-redux redux amazon-cognito-identity-js --save-dev

## For developers

If you want to hack on react-cognito itself:

Install the prerequisites:

    sudo apt install npm

Check out the code somewhere:

    git clone git@github.com:isotoma/react-cognito.git

Change into that directory, and then run the npm installer:

    npm install
